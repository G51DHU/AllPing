# DiscordBot_AllPing
The AllPing bot is intented to become an easy way to ping, ssh, portscan, and recieve info about domains. All from the comfort of discord.
In the future, integration with Rhasspy, Alexa and Google may be avaliable.

Current ability of AllPing;
      Ping URL
      Choose a favourite URL, that can be pinged by the use of short term word such as 	â€œhome"or	"default"
  
In order to use the bot, please change the token, and equip it with that of your own discord bot, and replace your "favourite" URL to a URL you would want to ping regularly.

This little project, was intended to be able to "ping" my raspberry pi device which ran Dietpi. But realised ICMP does not affect TCP, therefore went ahead with the little venture, and decided to create a multi-functioning bot, as my second attempt at a project.
