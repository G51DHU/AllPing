# DiscordBot_AllPing
Allows you to ping any url, that the "AllPing" bot is in.

replace token and favourite url.

I plan to add threading, so that i can ping my home router while the main script runs, and alrts if my home router is down. However I am having difficulties with asyncio. Therefore will try and update asap.
